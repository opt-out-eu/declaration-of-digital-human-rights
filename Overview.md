### Overview

[Declaration](https://github.com/opt-out-eu/declaration-of-digital-human-rights/blob/master/README.md), [Glossary](https://github.com/opt-out-eu/declaration-of-digital-human-rights/blob/master/Glossary.md)

Several alarming trends are currently influencing the digital space:

1. Individuals are constantly surveilled, and their behaviour systematically modified by both commercial entities and governments.
    1. Modern communication infrastructure is owned by a handful of private corporations whose business model involves modifying the behaviour of the individuals attempting to communicate with one another
2. Individual speech is restricted and censored 
3. Individuals must sacrifice their privacy in order to exercise their civil liberty
4. Access to the Internet and to specific Services on the Internet, and the User Experience of these Services is not granted on an equal basis
5. User Experiences are designed to be addictive
6. There is no way to opt-out of certain digital technologies without incurring a significant penalty to one’s civil liberty 
7. Interactions between individuals and organizations are rigged in favor of organizations (one example of this are one-sided terms and conditions)
8. Individuals inside organizations have no personal accountability for their actions, they hide behind the corporate veil
9. Vendors of digital goods carry no “product liability” for their Services
10. The move to subscription based cloud services blurs the line between ownership and a “license to use” the work products of an individual (ie. documents, images, etc. the individual creates) and allows organisations to make one-sided decisions to change the type of ownership retrospectively, often after the individual is invested in the platforme
11. Many individuals lack an in-depth understanding of the above trends and are being exploited by those who do (children are particularly susceptible to this form of abuse)
